# Mission-to-Mars
Using Mongo and flask
## Purpose-
  In this project we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and also the titles of those images, we stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, and used a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. Finally, using mongo and flask the data was easy to display.
  ## Results-
 - Scraping the data in this analysis provide us the following mars images and table with description.
